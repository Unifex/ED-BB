# Billionaires Boulevard (inspired by DtEA)
This is a tool for players of [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/). The origin of the tool started with the [Billionaires Boulevard](https://cmdrs-toolbox.com/billionaires-boulevard) from [Down to Earth Astronomy](https://www.youtube.com/c/DowntoEarthAstronomy). I found the list provided to be handy, but not that helpful as it didn't retain the state of your progress if you ever had to reload your browser. It also didn't really present the list in a manner that gave you an idea of where the systems were in the galaxy.

This tool resolves both of these issues.

## Credits
* The map is provided by [ED3D](https://github.com/gbiobob/ED3D-Galaxy-Map). It's old, a bit out of date, but works very well.
* The list of systems is from the [Billionaires Boulevard](https://cmdrs-toolbox.com/billionaires-boulevard) page assembled by [Down to Earth Astronomy](https://www.youtube.com/c/DowntoEarthAstronomy). The biologicals listed aren't the complete list on any given planet, but they are the high value items.
* The coordinates were initially being fetched from the [EDSM](https://www.edsm.net/) API. In order to not hammer the API on every page load these were eventually added to the source data. This tool would not have happened without that API though.
